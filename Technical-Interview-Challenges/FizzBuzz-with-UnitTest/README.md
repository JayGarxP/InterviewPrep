# C# Unit Tested FizzBuzz

Classic FizzBuzz is commented out in main.
Each iteration of FizzBuzz is written to a string array and compared in the unit tests using a container class, "FizzBuzz"

30 Minutes to write tests - then 10 to write the actual FizzBuzz,
I hardcoded it first with 3 condition checks then built a FB container class with a string array to mimic console output,
since unit testing console output is tricky. Missed a few edge cases, but it does work.
